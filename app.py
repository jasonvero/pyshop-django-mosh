# Django Framework

# A framework is a library of reusable modules (building blocks)
# These modules provide functionality for common tasks

# A framework also defines a structure for our applications
# It tells us what folders and files we should have in our project

# Executing in Terminal
    # pip install django ==2.1

    # pyshop-mosh> django-admin startproject pyshop .
        # This program takes various arguments.
        # 'startproject' arguement, with it create a project called pyshop in the current folder,
        # which is what the period represents
        # If you don't include the '.' period, it will create its own folder which will look repetitive
